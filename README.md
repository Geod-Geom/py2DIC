# py2DIC


py2DIC is a free and open-source Python software for 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) developed at the Geodesy and Geomatics Division of Sapienza University of Rome.

The software is based on the template matching method, a well-known technique for matching patterns using
cross-correlation, and returns the displacement and strain field by comparing 
two or more images of the sample acquired at different stages of deformation.
